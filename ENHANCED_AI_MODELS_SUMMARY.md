## Model Architecture

### Ensemble Approach
Each disaster type (flood, earthquake, landslide, wildfire, storm, tornado, drought) uses an ensemble of:
1. **Random Forest Regressor** (200 trees, optimized parameters)
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (200 estimators, adaptive learning)
3. **XGBoost Regressor** (200 estimators, advanced regularization)
4. **Support Vector Regression** (RBF kernel, optimized C and gamma)
5. **Multi-layer Perceptron** (256-128-64 neurons, adaptive learning)
6. **PyTorch Neural Network** (with attention and residual connections)

### Feature Engineering
- **Weather Features**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, precipitation, visibility, cloud cover, UV index, dew point, heat index, wind chill, precipitation intensity, atmospheric stability, moisture content
- **Geospatial Features**: Latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, aspect, soil type, land use, distance to water, distance to fault, population density, infrastructure density, historical events, tectonic zone, climate zone, vegetation index, urbanization level
- **Disaster-Specific Features**: River levels, drainage efficiency, seismic activity, ground acceleration, soil saturation, slope stability

## Performance Improvements

### Accuracy Enhancements
- **Multi-Model Validation**: Each model is validated using cross-validation
- **Performance Metrics**: R² score, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error
